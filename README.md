myRobotRemote Sketch
====================

This sketch is used to control the robot using an old, unused TV remote control.

The point is to learn how to capture the codes from the remote and use them to
control the robot.

In addition to the remote control, the robot still has some 'senses' in that it 
will try to perform edge detection. Don't want to run off the edge of the world.
